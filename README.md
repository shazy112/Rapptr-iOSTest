Rapptr iOS Test

Added base controller to redeuce effort and redundant code.
Made seperate extension and extension files so maximum methods can be reused.
Created UI using code based constraints and UI based constraints as well.
Used Alamofire for API request.
Used Color-Sets for assigning colors.
Created seperate fonts and colors for every component so incase if we change anything it reflects everywhere the reference is used.
Created custom reuseable components like textfields & buttons.
